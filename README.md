# MNIST Digit Classification with PyTorch

This project implements a simple fully connected neural network (MLP) to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset** using **PyTorch**.

The network consists of four fully connected layers with ReLU activations and is trained using the Adam optimizer.
